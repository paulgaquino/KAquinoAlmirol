      <p>
        The early Filipinos' were, for lack of a better term, animistic as they held a series of beliefs rooted in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and deities, and that respect should be given to them through worship and rituals. An example of these deities is Bathala. Others also worshipped the moon, sun, stars, and other objects in nature. Furthermore, animistic practices also varied within each community, but they all had similar features such as magic, chants, and prayers, along with practitioners who were either highly respected or feared in the community. Lastly, the early Filipinos also believed in mythical creatures like the aswang (vampire) and manananggal (baby-eating monster).

      <p>
        During the precolonial period, the early Filipinos had multiple different types of writing systems. One example is baybayin, which is written with sharp pointed sticks on leaves, bamboo sticks, and tree trunks. It is written from top to bottom and read from left to right. Furthermore, the Visayans, Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and other ethnic groups also have their own dialect and form of writing. This comprises of a 17-letter alphabet, 3 of which are vowels and 14 of which are consonants. Finally, the Muslims also have their own dialect. They are called the kirim of Maranao and jiwi of the Tausug. Both of these are still being used today.

      <p>
         The early Filipino men wore a loincloth known as bahag and a strip of cloth tied around their forehead known as putong. The women typically wore a skirt and top. In Luzon, it was known as the tapis. In Visayas, they wore rectangular one-piece checkered skirts known as patadyong. In Maranao and Maguindanao, the malong, a multi-purpose tubular garment worn by both females and males was the traditional dress. In the Bontok region, women wore a rectangular wrap skirt called the lufid. Depending on the occasiomn, the lufid could be worn in many ways. When working in the fields, they donned the knee-length kinarchago. During more formal occasions, they wore the inorma, a longer, more detailed skirt.

      <p> 
        Before the Spaniards came, the early Filipinos already had their own form of government. They lived in units called barangay, which consisted of about 100 families. Each barangay was independent from one another and had their own leaders, the datu. They were tasked with protecting and leading the members of the barangay. In return, the members of the barangay had to pay tribute to the datu, help him till the land, and fought for him in case of war. Back then, the datu had a council of elders who advised him. 
        <br>
        The datu position was passed down from the father to the eldest son, or if there are none, the eldest daughter. However, later on, anyone in the village could be the datu based off his talent and ability.

      <p> 
        The early Filipinos already had a system of social classes before the Spaniards came, along with a feudal system in parts of Mindanao thanks to Islam. The typical structure within a barangay was the maginoo or ruling class, which consisted of the datu and his family. Underneath them was the middle class, which consisted of the maharlika and timawa. The maharlika were the warriors of the barangay, and they were rewarded a share of the spoils after battles. The timawa were free people whose main purpose was agricultural labor, but they could perform a series of other tasks, like accompanying expeditions or building rowboats. Finally, the lowest class was the alipin, who were slaves. They were either aliping namamahay or slaves who lived in a house apart from their master or aliping gigilid or slaves who lived in the same house as their master. Members of this class include people who inherited debt and timawa who went into debt.
