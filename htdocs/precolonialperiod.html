        The early Filipinos' were, for lack of a better term, animistic as they held a series of beliefs rooted in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and deities, and that respect should be given to them through worship and rituals. An example of these deities is Bathala. Others also worshipped the moon, sun, stars, and other objects in nature. Furthermore, animistic practices also varied within each community, but they all had similar features such as magic, chants, and prayers, along with practitioners who were either highly respected or feared in the community. Lastly, the early Filipinos also believed in mythical creatures like the aswang (vampire) and manananggal (baby-eating monster).
