        The Portugese explorer Ferdinand Magellan first landed on the Philippines in March 1521. In 1565, the explorer Miguel Lopez de Legaspi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines in Cebu. Manila was founded in 1571, and by the end of the 16th century, most of the Philippines was under Spanish control. However, they were never able to colonize the Muslims of Mindanao and Sulu. 
      <br>
      </br>
        The Spanish colonization of the Philippines was not well received by the Filipinos due to their cruel treatment and erasure of their culture. There were several revolts by the Filipinos against the Spaniards, but none of them worked because most of the Filipino population sided with the Spaniards to avoid being persecuted themselves, and they lacked patriotism.
      <br>
      </br>
        Some of the major revolts include: the Lakandula and Soliman revolt (1574), the Maniago revolt (1660-1661), the Malong revolt (1660-1661), the Dagohoy rebellion (1744-1829), the Silang revolt (1762-1764), the Pule revolt (1840-1843), and the Cavite Mutiny (1872).
      <br>
      </br>
      <ol>
        <li>Lakandula and Soliman Revolt (1574)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Lakandula and Soliman revolt began because Legaspi promised that if they gave their kingdoms up, they would be treated well and retain some of their former powers. Legaspi did not keep his promise. Later, their exemption from paying tax was revoked and their lands were confiscated. The revolt was brutally crushed in 1574.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        </br>
        <li>Maniago Revolt and Malong Revolt (1660-1661)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Maniago revolt began as a result of the increased burden of more labor, tribute, and rice from the Spaniards on the Pampangans due to their wealth of resources. Francisco Maniago was able to convince many people to follow him by making them believe in the idea of freedom if they followed him, but he also lied and exaggerated his claims. However, the Spanish Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara was able to neutralize the rebellion by using the divide and rule trick. In the end, Maniago and his followers had no choice but to make peace with Governor de Lara, and he was never seen again. This was the start of a bloodier rebellion in Pampanga, known as the Malong revolt, which was led by Andres Malong. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        </br>
        <li>Dagohoy Rebellion (1744-1829)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Dagohoy revolt was started by Francisco Dagohoy after a parish priest refused to give his brother a proper Catholic burial. This was the longest revolt in Philippine history, lasting 85 years, but Dagohoy died two years before it ended. The revolt led to the creation of a free Boholano government and after it was dissolved, the members of the revolt were pardoned and allowed to live peacefully.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        </br>
        <li>Silang Revolt (1762-1764)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Silang revolt was led by the couple Diego and Gabriela Silang, and took place during the British invasion of Manila. On December 14, 1672, Diego declared Ilocandia a free state and named Vigan as its capital, prompting the British to ask them for help in fighting the Spanish. However, Diego was killed on May 28, 1763 by his friend. Gabriela continued the fight and was known as the Joan of Arc of the Ilocos. The revolt ended with the defeat of the Ilocanos, and Gabriela Silang was executed by the Spanish. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        </br>
        <li>Pule Revolt (1840-1843)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Pule revolt was led by Apolinario de la Cruz, also known as Hermano Pule. He started his own religious order, the Confraternity of Saint Joseph (Spanish: Confradia de San Jos√©) in Lucban, in June 1840. Spanish government banned the new order due to its deviation from original Catholic rituals and teachings. Pule and his followers were forced to defend themselves from the Spaniards. They lost, and Pule was executed on November 4, 1841. However, it did not stop there. On January 20, 1843, the regiment, led by Sergeant Irineo Samaniego, rose in mutiny, as many members of the Tayabas regiment of the Spanish military based in Malate in Manila, had relatives that were members of the order who were killed in the ensuing violence. However, they lost and Samaniego and his followers were executed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        </br>
        <li>Cavite Mutiny (1872)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Cavite Mutiny of 1872 was an uprising of the military personnel in Cavite, Philippines, on January 20. 1872. Around 200 personnel rose up against the government, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The government executed many of the participants.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Religion, Beliefs, and Mythology</h3>
      <img src="..\images\spanishperiod2.jpeg" height="100px" width="200px" title="Image">
      <p>
        Christianity is a big part of our culture, thanks to the Spanish. When Magellan first came to the Philippines, he converted as much as 2,200 native Filipinos to Christianity, and held the Philippines' first Mass. This trend continued with the rest of the Spanish colonizers who came to the Philippines. They forcibly converted most of the nation until almost everyone was a Christian. 
      <br>
      </br>
        The Church was a dominating force on the Philippines, and that continues today. The archbishop's power exceeded that of the Governor-General's in the 17th-18th century. The Church acquired a lot of wealth through royal grants and underhanded dealings. Their power also came from their knowledge of the Philippine language, which was better than most of the lay Spanish. Not only were they able to communicate with and influence the Filipinos more, but they were also a valuable source of information for the colonial government.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ways of Life</h3>
      <img src="..\images\spanishperiod4.jfif" height="100px" width="150px" title="Image">
      <p>
        At the start, Filipinos were treated very poorly by the Spaniards and were treated as subhuman. In the hierarchy of social classes, the Indios or native Filipinos were at the bottom. Over time, they gained more and more rights, though they were not equal to the Spanish and were often treated as inferior to them. In short, Spanish blood was indicative of status, and the more you had, the better you were treated. 
        <br>
        </br>
        There was a complex social structure during the Spanish Colonial period. At the very top were the peninsulares, or Spaniards who were born in Spain. They were the wealthiest and most politically powerful. Next were the Insulares, or Spaniards born in the Philippines. These people took high positions in the government but were discriminated against by the Peninsulares. After them were the Spanish Mestizos, or people with both Spanish and Filipino blood. Below them were the Principalia, or the nobility class. Next to them were Chinese. Below the Chinese were the Chinese Mestizos, or people with Chinese and Filipino blood. At the very bottom were the Indios, or pure-blooded Filipinos.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Education</h3>
      <img src="..\images\spanishperiod8.jfif" height="100px" width="200px" title="Image">
      <p>
        Education was highly regulated by the Spaniards. Until 1863, there was no public education in the Philippines, and the church controlled the curriculum. Only one-fifth of the educated population could read and write Spanish, and less could speak it properly. However, wealthy Filipinos were able to secure good educations for their children by sending them to Manila or abroad to Europe, where their minds were exposed to the political ideas brewing there.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Government</h3>
      <img src="..\images\spanishperiod7.jpg" height="125px" width="100px" title="Image">
        <h4>National Government</h4>
        <p>
          Since Spain was far away from the Philippines, they used a colonial government to rule. The Philippines was ruled by a governor-general, a Spaniard who was appointed by the King of Spain. He was the King's representative and the highest-ranking official in the Philippines. His powers included: the ability to dismiss and appoint public officials as he pleased, supervision of government offices, and collection of taxes. The only requirement was to be an peninsulares born in Spain.
          <br>
          </br>
          Due to how much power the governor-general was given, abuse of power was common. To investigate the abuse, these bodies of power were created:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Residencia</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This was a special judicial court that investigated the actions of the governor-general when he was about to leave office. The next governor-general was usually a member of the residencia. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>The Visita</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Council of the Indies in Spain sent a government official called the Visitador General to observe the conditions of the colony. He reported his findings directly to the king. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>The Royal Audencia</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This was the highest court in the land and served as an advisory body to the governor-general. They had the power to check and report his abuses and sent a report to the king about the colony every year. 
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Even so, an abusive governor-general managed to escape punishment by simply bribing these bodies of power. 
        </p>
        <h4>Provincial Government</h4>
        <p>
          There were two types of provincial government units: The alcaldia and corrigimiento. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The alcaldia, headed by the alcalde mayor, governed provinces that were fully under Spanish control. The alcalde mayor was tasked with representing the Spanish King and governor-general and managing day-to-day operations of the provincial government. The corrigimiento, on the other hand, was headed by the corregidor and governed provinces not fully under Spanish control. The two positions came with a small salary and a few privileges, like Indulto de Comercio, or the right to participate in the galleon trade. 
          <br>
          </br>
          The larger towns were called the ayuntamiento and became centers of trade and industry. They were headed by a city council called the cabildo, which consisted of the alcalde mayor, regidores (councillors), alguacil mayor (police chief), and escribando (secretary).
        </p>
        <h4>Municipal Government</h4>
        <p>
          Provinces are divided into towns or pueblos, each of which are headed by a gobernadorcillo. Their main duties were governance and collection of taxes. They had small salaries and were exempted from paying tax. The only qualification was to be either a native Filipino or Chinese mestizo. 
          <br>
          </br>
          The smallest unit of government was the barangay, or the barrio. These were headed by a cabeza de barangay, who were responsible for the peace and order of the barrio and recruitment of men for public works.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">End of Spanish Colonization</h3>

      <p style="float:right; text-align:left;">
          In the 1880s, sons of wealthy Filipinos were sent to Spain to study. There, nationalism and passion for reform blossomed. Out of this group of talented young men arose what was later known as the Propaganda movement. Jose Rizal, the movement's most notable figure, produced two novels: Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Reign of Greed), both of which had a widespread impact on the Philippines. Rizal was later arrested and executed. 
      <br>
      </br>
        Shocked by his arrest, his fellow activists formed the Katipunan, a Philippine nationalist organization led by Andres Bonifacio, in 1892. In 1896, friars uncovered evidence of the Katipunan's plans, which led to the Philippine Revolution. In 1897, a truce was concluded with the Spanish, and the leaders of the organization were allowed to go to Hong Kong. But reforms were slow, and they grew distrustful. 
      <br>
      </br>
        Meanwhile, war had broken out between Spain and the United States of America. After the US victory in 1898, the leaders of the revolution returned to the Philippines, confident of US support. Indepeendence was declared on June 12, and a contitutional congress met in Malolos to draw up a fundamental law. In January 1899, a government was formed on the basis of that institution with Aguinaldo as president and named the Malolos Republic. 
      <br>
      </br>
        However, the Americans did not actually support the Filipinos, and on December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which sold the Philippines to the United States for 20 million pesos. The Philippines was under foreign control once more.
